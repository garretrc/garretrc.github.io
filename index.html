<p>I am currently a second year student at Miami University of Ohio, where I major in Mathematics & Statistics with a Predictive Analytics Co-Major and minor in Computer Science. I plan to graduate in 2019 and seek graduate education in Statistics. This summer I have accepted a position with IBM as an Information Technology Intern in Research Triagle Park, NC.</p>

   <p><b>2016 GSS Data Challenge:</b> Starting January 2016, I worked with a team to scrape, wrangle and visualize data for car accidents (GES National Automotive Sampling System) and crash safety ratings (From the NHTSA and IIHS). See our <u><a href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/gssPaper.pdf">paper</a></u> and <u><a href="http://dataviz.miamioh.edu/nhtsaGesAnalysis/">R Shiny App</a></u> that were presented at the 2016 Joint Statistical Meetings. We are currently working on modeling probabilities of injuries in order to prepare our work to be submitted to <i>Computational Statistics.</i></p>
<p>During my time at Miami, I have been busy immersing myself in the Statistics Department and Center for Analytics and Data Science. Some of my accomplishments so far have been participating in the Government Section for Statistics 2016 Data Challenge, where my team worked for a semester to scrape, wrangle and visualize data for car accidents 
and car safety ratings. See our <u><a href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/gssPaper.pdf">paper</a></u> and <u><a href="http://dataviz.miamioh.edu/nhtsaGesAnalysis/">R Shiny App</a></u> from the 2016 GSS Data Challenge. We are currently adding on to the projectject, as we have been invited to submit our findings to <i>Computational Statistics.</i> I also participated in Miami's first annual DataFest, where my team of first-year classmates won Best in Show. See a picture of the team up top and <u><a href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/datafestsub.pdf">see our findings and data visualizations.</a></u>
 I'm currently working with a new team for the 2017 GSS Data Challenge. We have created a MySQL server for our project to manage over 15 GB of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Condumer Expenditure survey. I will be traveling to Baltimore in July to present our findings at the Joint Statistical Meetings.</p>
