**EMPLOYMENT**

*Cincinnati Children's Hospital* Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology \hfill May 2018-Present

As part of CCHMC's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship I worked with two seperate studies:

- Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS)

    + Compared the effectiveness and efficiency of Voronoi diagrams vs. square rasters in interpolating Random Forest predictions over the Greater Cincinnati area
    
    + Used various R spatial analysis packages, including sp, raster, rgdal and ggvoronoi to complete the analyses

- Pediatric Obesity Weight Evaluation Registry (POWER)

    + Aggregated and visualized quarterly data on the progess of Pediatric Obesity patients at 30+ hospitals in the US

    + Working to evaluate the effect of latitude on Vitamin D deficiencies in Pediatric Obesity patients
    
    + Used SAS programming for data processing and R packages ggplot2, shiny, and plotly for visualization


*IBM* Research Triangle Park, NC \hfill May 2017-May 2018  

- Integrated cognitive tools such as Watson Machine Learning, SPSS modeler, and R into blockchain networks in order to provide real-time analysis to users

- Automated quarterly factory incident report summaries in order to better inform the troubleshooting process

*Undergraduate Associate* Miami University \hfill January 2018-May 2018

- Worked with Dr. Karsten Maurer as an Undergraduate Associate for his STA 467 Statistical Learning course

    + Helped students with learning and troubleshooting R code for predictive modeling

    + Provided office hours to help with the term project, using machine learning algorithms, variable selection, and model ensembling to predict basketball statistics
