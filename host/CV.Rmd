**RESEARCH PROJECTS AND COMPETITIONS**

- *Functional Data Methods for Comparing Climate Models*, University of Illinois 2021

    + Working with Dr. Trevor Harris and Dr. Bo Li to create a functional data method suitable for comparing high-dimensional spatio-temporal data. Focus on applications to climate model validation.

- *Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling for Toixcology Studies*, Miami University Spring 2019

    + Worked with Dr. Jing Zhang to jointly model both growth and survival outcomes in toxicology studies involving Fathead Minnows. Using a Bayesian hierarchical approach in STAN, we were able to adjust for the effect of using multiple tanks of fish at a given concentration level as well as mitigate the effect of survival bias on estimated growth effects.

- *2018 Joint Statistical Meetings*, Data Expo hosted by ASA Section on Statistical Computing

    + Worked with a team of 4 students to evaluate errors in National Weather Service forecasts using data from National Climatic Data Center weather stations. Work was broken down into two projects: extending the forecasts from the NWS data to all of the NCDC weather stations and comparing the performance of NWS forecasts to that of a naive data-centric approach.
    
    + For the data-centric model project, I used ridge regression along with a hull-based spatial variable selection approach to create new weather forecasts for each NCDC weather station.

- *2017 Joint Statistical Meetings*, Data Challenge hosted by ASA Government Section on Statistics

    + Worked with one other student to analyze the BLS Consumer Expenditure dataset. Focusing on the Great Recession, I modeled consumer budgeting habits using a compositional data approach. I presented our findings at the JSM, where we won third place in the Data Challenge.

- *2016 Joint Statistical Meetings*, Team Member

    + Worked with a team of 4 students to model car crash injuries using beta-binomial regression. I was the primary maintainer for the project's crash safety ratings database, which required using API calls and web scraping to gather the dataset and rigorous data cleaning to prepare the data for modeling.

- *ASA DataFest*, hosted by Miami University

    + 2019, First place - Measured rugby player fatigue using player tracking data
    + 2018, First place - Analyzed Indeed/US Census data with Voronoi diagrams
    + 2017, Third place - Visualized Expedia user behavior with Alluvial diagrams
    + 2016, First place - Created a network-based ad suggestion algorithm for Ticketmaster
