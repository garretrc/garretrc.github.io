##<span style="color:#B93838">About me</span>

I am currently a third year student at Miami University of Ohio, where I major in Mathematics & Statistics with a Predictive Analytics Co-Major and minor in Computer Science. I plan to graduate in 2019 and seek graduate education in Statistics. While working towards my degree, I am employed as a Data Science Intern for IBM. I work with a team from Research Triangle Park, NC to integrate cognitive tools into blockchain-based business networks.

**2016 GSS Data Challenge:** Starting January 2016, I worked with a team to scrape, wrangle and visualize data for car accidents (GES National Automotive Sampling System) and crash safety ratings (From the NHTSA and IIHS). <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/gssPaper.pdf">paper</a></u> and <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="http://dataviz.miamioh.edu/nhtsaGesAnalysis/">R Shiny App</a></u> that was presented at the 2016 Joint Statistical Meetings. We are currently working on modeling probabilities of injuries in order to prepare our work to be submitted to *Computational Statistics*.

**2016 DataFest at Miami University:** I participated in Miami's first annual DataFest, where my team of first-year classmates won Best in Show. See a picture of the team up top and <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/datafestsub.pdf">see our findings and data visualizations</a></u> of our ad suggestion algorithms for TicketMaster.

**2017 GSS Data Challenge:** During the spring and summer of 2017 I worked with a team of students to analyze the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey Data. We leveraged the data to view the effect of the Great Recession on individual consumers. This past July, I traveled to Baltimore, MD and presented our findings at the Joint Statistical Meetings. We placed third in the competition despite being the only undergraduate team to participate! I am currently working to summarise our work and submit a paper to the *JSM Proceedings* and *Computational Statistics*.

**2017 DataFest at Miami University:** My friends and I recently finished our second DataFest! We placed third place with our analysis of browsers vs. buyers on Expedia. Check out our <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/SQLpaper.pdf">presentation</a></u> and alluvial diagram.

**2017 PittBusiness Analytics Case Competition:** I recently traveled to Pittsburgh to compete in this competition with some of my Senior Classmates at Miami. We created a <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/pittsburgh2017.pdf">data-centric process</a></u> for determining market potential of our product.
