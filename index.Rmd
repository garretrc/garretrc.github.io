## <span style="color:#B93838">About me</span>

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at the University of Illinois and alumnus of Miami University. Currently in my last year of study while working as an intern for the Statistics department at Sandia National Labs. I work on problems in Spatiotemporal Statistics, particularly on models and metrics for climate datasets.

**ggvoronoi:** An R package for creating quick and customizable Voronoi Chloropleth Diagrams with ggplot2. Built with my friend Austin Nar based on our work at DataFest 2018. Tutorial here: <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="http://garretrc.github.io/host/ggvoronoi.R">ggvoronoi.R</a></u> and repository on my <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://github.com/garretrc/ggvoronoi">github</a></u>.

**2016 GSS Data Challenge:** Starting January 2016, I worked with a team to scrape, wrangle and visualize data for car accidents (GES National Automotive Sampling System) and crash safety ratings (From the NHTSA and IIHS). <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/gssPaper.pdf">paper</a></u> and <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="http://dataviz.miamioh.edu/nhtsaGesAnalysis/">R Shiny App</a></u> that was presented at the 2016 Joint Statistical Meetings. We are currently working on modeling probabilities of injuries in order to prepare our work to be submitted to *Computational Statistics*.

**2016 DataFest at Miami University:** I participated in Miami's first annual DataFest, where my team of first-year classmates won Best in Show. See a picture of the team up top and <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/datafestsub.pdf">see our findings and data visualizations</a></u> of our ad suggestion algorithms for TicketMaster.

**2017 GSS Data Challenge:** During the spring and summer of 2017 I worked with a team of students to analyze the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey Data. We leveraged the data to view the effect of the Great Recession on individual consumers. This past July, I traveled to Baltimore, MD and presented our findings at the Joint Statistical Meetings. We placed third in the competition despite being the only undergraduate team to participate! I am currently working to summarise our work and submit a paper to the *JSM Proceedings* and *Computational Statistics*.

**2017 DataFest at Miami University:** My friends and I recently finished our second DataFest! We placed third place with our analysis of browsers vs. buyers on Expedia. Check out our <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/SQLpaper.pdf">presentation</a></u> and alluvial diagram.

**2017 PittBusiness Analytics Case Competition:** I recently traveled to Pittsburgh to compete in this competition with some of my Senior Classmates at Miami. We created a <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/pittsburgh2017.pdf">data-centric process</a></u> for determining market potential of our product.

**2018 DataFest at Miami University:** My team recently placed first in Miami University's 2018 DataFest with our analysis of Indeed.com's job listing data. Using regional information to link the dataset to US Census Bureau data, we were able to create a metric for talent/job listing imbalances in US metropolitan areas. See our full presentation <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/host/ANOVAdatafest.pdf">here</a></u>, and check out our ggvoronoi package for some tools we developed during the competition!

**Nodesplosion:** A game playable on any connected, undirected graph based on the premise that a node can hold as many dots as its number of edges and explodes its dots into its neighbors upon surpassing that capacity. Made as a fun project along with Bob Krueger, Hana Ritchie and John Biggs. Playable on my website at <u><a style="color: #b93838" href="https://garretrc.github.io/splode">garretrc.github.io/splode</a></u>.
